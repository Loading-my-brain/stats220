## Project requirements

### Briefly summaries how you have met the requirements related to working with GitHub and GitHub pages.

### The links to my repo and my web

Here's [my repository]() in GitHub. Here's the [link]() to my website in GitHub.

### Ingredients for my meme + GIF creation

1.  My **first task** was to create a "meme-image", and I used the following images:

!["consulting image"](images/consult.jpg)
!["serious face image"](images/results.jpg)
!["meme character guy"](images/doc.jpg)
!["wierd doctor"](images/docs.jpg)

**This created: **
![](images/my_meme.png)

2. My **second task** was to create an animated GIF, and I used the following images:

!["Friends image"](images/1.png)
![1st image to the "calculating image"](images/2.png)
![2nd image to the "calculating image"](images/3.png)
![3rd image to the "calculating image"](images/4.png)
![4th image to the "calculating image"](images/5.png)

This created: 

![](images/my_animation.gif)

Ps. the names are what I've personally came up with.

### Demonstration of my own creativity?

My creations used additional functions from the {magick} package that were not covered in the course as well as using more CSS than what was required to change the appearance of my HTML. This consequently allowed me to add my personal specifications on the appearances of my meme, GIF and my HTML output creations:

1. ***My "Meme creation" & my "Animated GIF creation"***

-   `image_negate functions`: I have used this in my meme creation with my final image to not only fit the blue-colored theme in the rest of the frames, but to also provide accent to my final model.
-   The specifics in the `image_annotate function`, such as as adjusting the location, angle/degree and the box color.

2. ***HTML output.***

-   I have used two different fonts in my HTML output; one for the title and the headings and the other for the body text paragraphs. The title and the headings were given a specific font so that I could fit my "space-game" theme, but I used a different font for the body paragraphs so that the texts were more readable.
-   I've made my headings located in the center of the page.
-   I've used specific colors for the title, subtitles and the headings; purple and pink.
-   I've finally used a cool [GIF](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/88/15/63/881563d6444b370fa4ceea0c3183bb4c.gif) I found online to apply it in my background for index file.

## Learning reflection

There are many new things I've learnt since I enrolled in STATS 220, and even more, after I've applied the learning to action through this current project.

My top 3 key Leanings are:

1.  ***Use of new functions***

-   I familiarized myself with the new functions I had never used before, including all of the functions in the `magick` package. This could be the most game-changing experience ever because I can see how I can efficiently utilize these functions in my future research and studies.

2.  ***How to research.***

-   Because there were some effects I precisely wanted to use in my meme creations, I was required to research the methods and techniques, which also played a great role in my learning journey; I now know how to read the essential sources online.

3.  ***Learning the joy of approaching art differently.***

-   During this project, my friends and I shared our ideas and showed our final model. Our responses came out something like: "Wow, look at what this function can do!?", "I can use this in here!", and "that's pretty cool", and this drove me towards finishing the project.

### What do I want to explore now?

Firstly, I know that I will be learning many new things in this course, and I hope to learn them all very well. Besides that, I'm especially excited to go in-depth with tidyverse as I've heard that this is an essential learning package for all statisticians. I'm sure that it would serve its greatest assistance to me in the future when I am required to handle with data.
