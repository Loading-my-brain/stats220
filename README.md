## BUT WAIT! Who am I!? 
I am an undergraduate student from the University Of Auckland majoring in the beautiful field of âœ¨**Statistics**âœ¨. Although Statistics is my major and joy, I am also interested in other areas: *Chemistry(!), Communications, Biology and Commerce*. So, I am on a Journey to find my forever passion and overall refinement!

### I am known to be an: 
1. Ambivert
    - I love interacting with people I've never met at social events and becoming real good friends later in time. Yet, I also love the comfort of my home-sweet-home. 
2. Soft-hearted 
    - Yes, I'm kind and caring. BUT! I'm also very cheerful ðŸŽ¶
3. ISFJ OR ESFJ from the Myersâ€“Briggs Type Indicator: 
    - I always seem to get the either. 
    - More infomration on Myersâ€“Briggs Type Indicators [here](https://www.myersbriggs.org/my-mbti-personality-type/mbti-basics/#:~:text=The%20identification%20and%20description%20of%20the%2016%20distinctive%20personality%20types%20that%20result%20from%20the%20interactions%20among%20the%20preferences.%22)

## Purpose 
The motive of this project is to show what I am currently studying, specifically what I am currently learning in [STATS 220 : Data Technologies](https://courseoutline.auckland.ac.nz/dco/course/STATS/220/1213). This is my first project assigned, where I am applying what I've learnt into practice.

## What I enjoyed 
I NEVER THOUGHT THAT I COULD MAKE MEMES AND ANIMATIONS FOR MY FIRST PROJECT! Making them was really fun, and I hope my viewers appreciate what I've attempted to make. 

My fav meme of all time:
